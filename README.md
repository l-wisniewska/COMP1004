This is a recipe organiser Single Page Web Application, to use it i used a Live Preview extension in VS Code but it should work on a browser.
You can add recipes by adding the name, ingredients and method then clicking add recipe
add recipe saves your written recipe and you can then either delete or download it as a .json file onto your computer
you can also upload your own json recipes, or the ones you have downloaded previously by clicking choose file, choosing your file then clicking upload.
